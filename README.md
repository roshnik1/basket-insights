# Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis Dashboard
This project analyzes the Instacart dataset to uncover key insights into customer purchasing behavior and product trends. By using Python for data processing and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard provides a clear view of metrics such as order frequency, reorder rates, basket sizes, and top products. The analysis helps identify patterns in customer preferences and product demand across various departments, offering valuable insights for improving inventory management and marketing strategies.

## Initial Questions
- What are the most frequently purchased products?  
- How does order frequency vary over time?  
- Which aisles or departments see the most activity?  
- What are the peak shopping times?  
- Customer segmentation: How do different user groups behave?
